Mocker - Microservices Mocking Framework
=======================================

### About Mocker

Mocker is a simple framework that allows you to mock the dependencies of your 
microservices. It is based on the "Consumer-Driven Contracts" pattern
and uses contracts for validating the expectations on both consumer and producer sides.

### Development Stack

Mocker is developed on PHP7 (is not backwards compatible with PHP5) and uses Redis as its storage engine.
